Common_Cartridge_v5.stl: This file describes a holder for four 50-mL falcon tubes. We use this holder with a custom-built fluidics system.  

## Magnet holder
MagneticHolder_v2.stl: This file contains a holder for two 50-mL falcon tubes and a 1" diameter neodymium magnet from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/5862K344/). This holder is useful for large-scale magentic bead separations. Please be exceedingly careful in assembling this system, as the magnet is very strong.
